# Thrust

TLDR; Checkout the game at http://demo.saygoweb.com/thrust

This is a 2D game with a bit of a nod to the Commodore 64 game 'Thrust' which I remember (vaguely) from the late '80s.  The game is more of a fusion of Lunar Lander, Thrust, Gravity, and the like.

## Game Play

- left / right rotate the ship.
- up provides thrust in the direction the ship is pointing.
- space fires.

Avoid the enemy bullets, rescue your companions and return them to the base.  Don't run out of fuel, and don't sustain too much damage.

Currently this is just my experiment with the [Phaser](http://phaser.org) HTML5 game framework.
